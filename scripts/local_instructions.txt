Make sure you have mysql installed, and the bin folder is added to your PATH variables.

Partially following this part of the manual:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/database-use.html


mysql -h host -u user -p // host is probably localhost, user is probably root
CREATE DATABASE dev_sbcs;  // Database name is case-sensitive
USE dev_sbcs

Go to the mysql workbench, and open your local instance.
Open up the sql scripts.

There will be a small lightning bolt symbol without the I or a magnify glass. This will run all of the code in the currently opened script, or all the currently selected/highlighted lines.

Type out the following and run it.

USE dev_sbcs;

Then run the "create_tables.sql" to create the appropriate tables, and "mock_data.txt" to add some rows to the Members table.
